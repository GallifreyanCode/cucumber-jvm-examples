Feature: Account Holder withdraws cash
	As an Account Holder
	I want to withdraw cash from an ATM
	So that I can get money when the bank is closed
 
	Scenario Outline: Account has sufficient funds
		Given the account balance is <account_balance>
 			And the card is valid
 			And the machine contains <atm_available>
		When the Account Holder requests <request>
		Then the ATM should dispense <result>
 			And the account balance should be <newBalance>
 			And the card should be returned
 	
 	Examples:
 		|account_balance|atm_available|request|result|newBalance|
 		|100            |100          |20     |20    |80        |
  		|110            |110          |20     |20    |90        |
